"Independent variable timestep integration of individual neurons for
network simulations" is a methods paper which demonstrates that
the local variable step method has better performance than the fixed
step method for networks in which only a few cells are active at a time.

The files reproduce fig 1 and 3 and provide a test framework for
observing performance for the worst case Wang and Buzsaki model
and the best case Ring model.
